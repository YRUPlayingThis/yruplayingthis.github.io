            <b>Details: </b>
            My next step after forming this website is to begin studying TryHackMe courses.
            The idea behind this is to introduce myself to computer and network basics, 
            familiarize myself with server systems, Operating Systems like linux and window servers,
            and to get learn about different IT roles related to Cybersecurity.
            Notes will be taken on this site for learning and reference purposes, along 
            with courses I complete or am progressing.

              <b>Details: </b>
              This was the first goal I had, to build a quick index.html script that I could host through github,
              so that I could build up to what my website is now today. To accomplish this, there was a decent amount of research on
              html basics, how github worked, how hosting the site worked, and finding better ways to edit/check my github code, 
              all of which led me to accomplish what I set out to do.<br>
              The feeling of setting out to get a goal you know nothing about accomplished and actually do it will always feel amazing to me 
              and is honestly serving as motivation for the rest of my future projects. If I could do this, I can figure out the next goal as well.

            <p class="answer">
              <b>Dates:</b> Began 5-23-2025, Finished 6-10-2025<br>
              <b>Details:</b> 
              I have worked to accomplish a few different objectives; 
              create my format for 4 web pages (home, progress, notes, and projects), 
              a css style to use across my website, 
              and then finally populate said pages with any relevant information 
              (adding my projects, goals, notes, and etc. to their respective pages page)
              <br>It took a while due to gaps in time of me working on this site, 
              but I still managed to get everything I set out to do done, starting with
              the completion of my project page, onto the home, then progress, and finally finishing with 
              the note page. The note page was the most advanced for me, as I wanted to create a 
              note format that would be practical. Though there are plenty more additions possible, I will
              wait to touch up my work until the current format takes too much space
              or unless better accessibility is desired.

      <p>In this category, all of my failed or no longer pursued projects are listed.
        I will include details on why they ended up in this state, whether it be me being 
        too ambitious, no longer a priority, or some other reason, along with any thoughts 
        I took away after putting this goal aside.
