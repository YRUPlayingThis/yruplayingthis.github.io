      <!-- 1st, Current Goals Listed Below-->
      <h2>Currrent Goals</h2><hr>
      <p>Below are all of my goals I am currently looking to puruse along with their meaning! 
        Each goal will be marked as either in progress or not started.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><!--Format Site, Goal 1-->
          <details> 
            <summary>(Work In Progress) Format my Site</summary>
            <p>
              <b>Dates: Began 5-23-2025</b><br>
              <b>Details:</b> 
              I will be working to accomplish a few different objectives; 
              create my format for 4 web pages (home, progress, notes, and projects), 
              a css style to use across my website, 
              and then finally populate said pages with any relevant information 
              (adding my projects, goals, notes, and etc. to their respective pages page)
            </p>
          </details>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <!-- 2nd, Completed Goals Listed Below-->
      <br><h2>Completed Goals</h2><hr>
      <p>Here lies my completed goals. Stated under them will be details such as their 
        start and end dates, major milestones, and any thoughts I had before, during, or after working on them!</p>
      <ul>
        <li><!--Host website and run it, 1st finished goal-->
          <details> 
            <summary>Get Website Hosted and Running</summary>
            <p><b>Dates:</b> Accomplished on 5-14-2025<br>
              <b>Details: </b>
              This was the first goal I had, to build a quick index.html script that I could host through github,
              so that I could build up to what my website is now today. To accomplish this, there was a decent amount of research on
              html basics, how github worked, how hosting the site worked, and finding better ways to edit/check my github code, 
              all of which led me to accomplish what I set out to do.<br>
              The feeling of setting out to get a goal you know nothing about accomplished and actually do it will always feel amazing to me 
              and is honestly serving as motivation for the rest of my future projects. If I could do this, I can figure out the next goal as well.
            </p>

      <!-- 3rd, Abandoned/Failed Goals Listed Below-->
      <br><h2>Goals to Revisit (Failed or not Prioritized)</h2><hr>
      <p>In this category, all of my failed or no longer pursued projects are listed.
        I will include details on why they ended up in this state, whether it be me being 
        too ambitious, no longer a priority, or some other reason, along with any thoughts 
        I took away after putting this goal aside.
