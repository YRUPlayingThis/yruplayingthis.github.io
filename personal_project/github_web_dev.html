          How I Started my First Github Website <br>(With No Experince)
        </h1>
        <p>
          As of <time datetime="2025-05-14"><b>5-14-2025</b></time>, I have just figured out how to launch and edit my own website and repository through the use of 
          <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>.
        It is now my intention to showcase to you, reader, how I managed to do it with no previous experience with Github, or web development!
      </p>

        <section>
          <h2 id="git">Setting up with Github</h2>
          <p>In this section we will go over the bare minimum to host a github website, requiring only a device and the website itself</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Create your Github Account</li>
            <li>Create your first (or new) repository, name it:<br>
              <code>(your Username here).github.io</code><br>
              Ensure that your github username is before the first period and in ALL lowercase characters!
            </li>
            <li>Go to the Main Branch and click <code>Add file -> Create new file</code> and call it <code>index.html</code></li>
            <li>Go to your <b>Repo Settings > Pages</b> and then set your branch to <code>main</code> (in the root folder)</li>
            <li>If all well, your html code, and therefore webpage, is now hosted at<br><code>https://(your username here).github.io</code></li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Small Optional steps I Followed</h3>
          <p>I personally took time to add a few different folders within my main directory with their own index.htmls within them to create multiple pages within my website.
            <br>If you wish to do the same, then when creating a new file, write <br><code>(folder name)/index.html</code>
          <br>This creates a new default directory and the folder that contains it, visiting it with something such as <code>(username)/github.io/(folder name)</code> now takes the user to that page!</p>
          <p>I also created a <code>style.css</code> file in the main directory, putting most of all my styling preferences on it and referring to it within all my pages' html code. Its as simple as adding a file and naming it <b>style.css</b>
          <br>This allows me to add the formating, colors, and text effects you see within this website now!</p>

        <!--Optional Things-->
        <section>
          <h2 id="op">Editing your Github Repo Locally</h2>
            <p>
              These are now the steps that I myself followed to begin working on this very website
              from my pc. After these steps, you will get to code offline, 
              check how your edits look before a commitment, and see your files in a neatly organized fashion.
              With these steps, life will get a lot easier to actively work on your repo!
            </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Download both Visual Studio Code, and Git for Windows from their websites
            </li>
            <li>
              Once Git has downloaded, set your Git identity by doing the following:<br>
              <code>
                git config --global user.name "name"
                <br>git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
              </code><br>
              Replace the quoted text with your name, and then email respectively
            </li>  
            <li>
              Open Visual Studio Code and sign in with your GitHub Account
            </li>
            <li>
              Clone your repo into VS Code with the GitHub URL button by going to your repo, clicking on<br>
              <code>Code -> HTTPS </code> and then copy the link right below the HTTPS<br>
              In VS Code, open the command palette with <code>Ctrl + Shift + P</code>
               and type <code>Git: Clone</code><br>
               After pressing enter you should be able to paste your link in.
               <br>You may also try to clone your repo link through the VS Code <b>Source Control Tab</b> on the left side of the program
            </li>
            <li>
              To test your files and site before committing your changes, 
              click on Extensions on the left tab (bottom option)
              and search for <b>Live Server Extension</b>. This will allow you to right click 
              on your html file and run it on a live server, 
              seeing the web page to ensure your edits are correct before you committ your changes!
            </li>
            <li>
              Now you can work freely with your repos synced, simply make sure to save your files when done editing them
              <br>(<code>Ctrl + S</code>) and when you're happy with your work, go to the <b>Source Control</b> tab
              and click commit (the message is a summary of your update). This updates your local repository. 
              <br>Press the <b>Sync</b> button in the same spot to then share your changes to your Github repo online
              and boom!
              <br>You can now freely edit and review your repo on your local pc 
              and then share changes to the website without even touching a web browser!
